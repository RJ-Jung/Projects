# Introduction
If you're familiar with stock trading you may have heard of demo/simulated trading or proprietary trading firms as well as brokers or exchanges that often run competitions in trading a specific commodity or instrument or whatever they offer, With the higest percent gainers at end of the time period being the winner using whatever stragety they prefer wiout breaching the terms & conditions. These strategies could range from pure instinct and gambaling to proprietary coded algorithmic trading and everything in between. Im going to be analyzing the trades taken personally on one of these competitions as well as the first place contestant to find patterns and trends in successful trading history and improve future trading results.

This gives us access to the competition dashboard which looks like this.
